					<p>There is a beautiful poem on Rewi’s defence of Orakau in Mr. Bracken’s “Lays of the Land of the Maori and Moa.” The description of this noble defence there given is quite accurate.<a href="preface-2.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>If a child was born before its time, and thus perished without having known the joys and pleasures of life, it was carefully buried with peculiar incantations and ceremonies; because if cast into the water, or carelessly thrown aside, it became a malicious being or spirit, actuated by a peculiar antipathy to the human race, who it spitefully persecuted, from having been itself deprived of happiness which they enjoyed. All their malicious deities had an origin of this kind.<a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This quarrel of Maui with his brother-in-law, Irawaru, is sometimes narrated in this way:<br/>
					Maui and his brother-in-law had been paying a visit to the people of a village not very distant from where they lived; when they were about to return home again, Maui asked his brother-in-law to carry a little provision for them both upon their short journey, but Irawaru answered surlily, “What should I carry any provision for? Why I have just had an excellent meal.” They then started, and Maui, who was very angry, by his enchantments drew out the earth as they proceeded, so as to lengthen exceedingly the road they had to traverse; at last, being both overcome by hunger and fatigue, they sat down to rest, and Maui, who knew what his intentions were before they started, and had brought provisions with him, eat a good meal, but gave none to his brother-in-law. He then, to throw Irawaru off his guard, asked him to clean and dress his hair for him, and laid his head on his lap for that purpose; when his own was finished, he offered to do the same for Irawaru, who suspecting no harm laid his head on Maui’s lap, who threw him into an enchanted sleep, and then by his enchantments changed him into a dog.<a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-6" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The European reader cannot at all enter into p. 53 the witty nature of this adventure in the estimation of a Maori; the idea of a sacred chief of high rank being by mistake treated as a common slave, conveys impressions to their minds of which we can form no accurate notion.<a href="chapter-3.xhtml#noteref-10" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The discovery of a plot by guessing the meaning of a song which persons were overhead singing was a common circumstance with all the races and throughout all the islands of the Pacific; for instance, in Pitcairn’s Island, when first occupied by part of the crew of <em>The Bounty</em> and some Tahitian men and women, we find:<br/>
					‘Brown and Christian were very intimate, and their two wives overhead one night Williams’s second wife sing a song. <em>Why should the Tahitian men sharpen their axes to cut off the Englishmen’s heads?</em> The wives of Brown and Christian told their husbands what Williams’s second wife had been singing; when Christian heard of it, he went by himself with his gun to the house where all the Tahitian men were assembled; he pointed his gun at them, but it missed fire. Two of the natives ran away into the bush.’⁠—<em>Pitcairn’s island and the Islander</em>.<a href="chapter-13.xhtml#noteref-22" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
